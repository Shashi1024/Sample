## Answers & Explanations



**1. (C) $2K + h\nu_0$**

* Case 1: $K = h\nu - h\nu_0$  (Equation 1)

* Case 2: $K_{new} = h(2\nu) - h\nu_0 = 2(h\nu) - h\nu_0$

* From (1), $h\nu = K + h\nu_0$.

* Substitute this into Case 2: $K_{new} = 2(K + h\nu_0) - h\nu_0 = 2K + 2h\nu_0 - h\nu_0 = 2K + h\nu_0$.



**2. (C) $\frac{v}{4\pi}$**

* Heisenberg's Principle: $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \ge \frac{h}{4\pi}$. For minimum uncertainty, $\Delta x \cdot (m\Delta v) = \frac{h}{4\pi}$.

* de Broglie's equation: $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$. So, $v = \frac{h}{m\lambda}$.

* Given $\Delta x = \lambda$.

* Substitute into Heisenberg's: $\lambda \cdot (m\Delta v) = \frac{h}{4\pi} \implies \Delta v = \frac{h}{4\pi m\lambda}$.

* Now substitute $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$: $\Delta v = \frac{h}{4\pi m (\frac{h}{mv})} = \frac{h \cdot mv}{4\pi m h} = \frac{v}{4\pi}$.



**3. (D) 12**

* We need $n=4$ and $m_l = +1$ or $m_l = -1$.

* This is not possible for $l=0$ ($4s$), as $m_l$ is only 0.

* For $l=1$ ($4p$): $m_l = +1$ and $m_l = -1$ are two orbitals. Each holds 2 electrons. Total = 4 electrons.

* For $l=2$ ($4d$): $m_l = +1$ and $m_l = -1$ are two orbitals. Each holds 2 electrons. Total = 4 electrons.

* For $l=3$ ($4f$): $m_l = +1$ and $m_l = -1$ are two orbitals. Each holds 2 electrons. Total = 4 electrons.

* Total electrons = $4 (from 4p) + 4 (from 4d) + 4 (from 4f) = 12$.



**4. (D) Alpha particle**

* $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$. K.E. = $\frac{p^2}{2m}$, so $p = \sqrt{2m(\text{K.E.})}$.

* $\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2m(\text{K.E.})}}$.

* Since K.E. is constant, $\lambda \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}$.

* The particle with the largest mass ($m$) will have the shortest wavelength ($\lambda$).

* Mass order: $m_{\alpha} > m_n \approx m_p > m_e$. The alpha particle is the heaviest.



**5. (A) 1:2**

* Time period $T = \frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Velocity}} = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$.

* Bohr's relations: $r \propto \frac{n^2}{Z}$ and $v \propto \frac{Z}{n}$.

* Substitute: $T \propto \frac{(n^2/Z)}{(Z/n)} \implies T \propto \frac{n^3}{Z^2}$.

* $T_1$ (H atom, $n=1, Z=1$): $T_1 \propto \frac{1^3}{1^2} = 1$.

* $T_2$ ($\text{He}^+$ ion, $n=2, Z=2$): $T_2 \propto \frac{2^3}{2^2} = \frac{8}{4} = 2$.

* Ratio $T_1 : T_2 = 1:2$.



**6. (D) $n=3, l=1, m_l=-2, m_s=+1/2$**

* The rules for quantum numbers are:

    * $l$ can be $0$ to $n-1$.

    * $m_l$ can be $-l$ to $+l$.

* In option (D), $l=1$. Therefore, $m_l$ can only be -1, 0, or +1. It cannot be -2.



**7. (A), (B), (C), (D)**

* (A) $\psi$ for all $p, d, f$ orbitals (any orbital with $l>0$) is zero at the nucleus ($r=0$). True.

* (B) $3p_z$ orbital: $n=3, l=1$. Radial nodes = $n - l - 1 = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$. True.

* (C) $3p_z$ orbital: $l=1$. Angular nodes = $l = 1$. True.

* (D) The angular node for a $p_z$ orbital is the $xy$-plane (where $z=0$ or $\theta = 90^\circ$). By definition, the probability density $\psi^2$ is zero at a node. True.



**8. (A), (B), (C)**

* (A) K.E. = $-(\text{T.E.})$. T.E. = $-K$. Total Energy = $\frac{-kZ^2e^2}{2r_n}$. Kinetic Energy = $\frac{kZ^2e^2}{2r_n}$. True.

* (B) P.E. = $2 \times (\text{T.E.})$. Potential Energy = $\frac{-kZ^2e^2}{r_n}$. This is twice the total energy. True.

* (C) $v_n = (\frac{2\pi kZ e^2}{h}) \frac{1}{n}$. So $v_n \propto \frac{Z}{n}$. For H-atom ($Z=1$), $v_n \propto \frac{1}{n}$. True.

* (D) $r_n = (\frac{h^2}{4\pi^2 mk e^2}) \frac{n^2}{Z}$. So $r_n \propto \frac{n^2}{Z}$. The radius is proportional to $n^2$, not $n$. False.



**9. (A), (B), (C)**

* (A) For a $1s$ orbital, $\psi$ has its maximum value at the nucleus ($r=0$), so $\psi^2$ is also maximum at the nucleus. True.

* (B) Radial probability distribution function ($4\pi r^2 R^2$) vs $r$ plot for $2s$ (which has one radial node) starts at 0, has a small peak, goes to 0 at the node, then rises to a second, larger peak. It has two regions of probability, hence two peaks. True.

* (C) $\psi$ is a wave amplitude and can be positive or negative (e.g., the two lobes of a $p$-orbital). $\psi^2$ (probability density) must be positive. True.

* (D) $d_{xy}$ orbital has $l=2$, so it has $l=2$ angular nodes (the $xz$ and $yz$ planes). False.



**10. 3.32**

* 1. Find the initial state $n$:

    * $\Delta E = 13.6 \times Z^2 (\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2})$

    * $108.8 \text{ eV} = 13.6 \times (3^2) (\frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{n^2})$

    * $108.8 = 122.4 (1 - \frac{1}{n^2})$

    * $\frac{108.8}{122.4} = \frac{8}{9} = 1 - \frac{1}{n^2}$

    * $\frac{1}{n^2} = 1 - \frac{8}{9} = \frac{1}{9} \implies n=3$.

* 2. Find the radius of this orbit ($n=3, Z=3$):

    * $r_n = 0.529 \frac{n^2}{Z} \text{ Å} = 0.529 \times \frac{3^2}{3} = 0.529 \times 3 = 1.587 \text{ Å}$.

* 3. Find the de Broglie wavelength:

    * Bohr's quantization: $mvr = \frac{nh}{2\pi} \implies p = mv = \frac{nh}{2\pi r}$.

    * de Broglie: $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$.

    * $\lambda = \frac{h}{(nh / 2\pi r)} = \frac{2\pi r}{n}$.

    * $\lambda = \frac{2 \times 3.14 \times 1.587 \text{ Å}}{3} = \frac{9.966}{3} \approx 3.32 \text{ Å}$.



**11. 9**

* Radial nodes = $n - l - 1$. We need $n-l-1 \ge 1$.

* $n=4$ shell has $4s, 4p, 4d, 4f$.

* $4s$ ($l=0$): $4-0-1 = 3$ radial nodes. (1 orbital)

* $4p$ ($l=1$): $4-1-1 = 2$ radial nodes. (3 orbitals)

* $4d$ ($l=2$): $4-2-1 = 1$ radial node. (5 orbitals)

* $4f$ ($l=3$): $4-3-1 = 0$ radial nodes. (7 orbitals)

* Total orbitals with at least one radial node = $1 (4s) + 3 (4p) + 5 (4d) = 9$.



**12. 0.84**

* Rydberg formula: $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R Z^2 (\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2})$

* Balmer series: $n_1 = 2$.

* Third line: $n_2 = 2+3 = 5$.

* Atom: $\text{He}^+$ ion, $Z=2$.

* $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \cdot (2^2) (\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{5^2}) = 4R (\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{25}) = 4R (\frac{25-4}{100}) = 4R (\frac{21}{100}) = \frac{84R}{100}$.

* $\frac{1}{\lambda} = 0.84 R$.

* The question asks for $\frac{1}{\lambda R} = \frac{0.84 R}{R} = 0.84$.



**13. 653**

* 1. Energy of incident photon: $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV-nm}}{248 \text{ nm}} = 5.0 \text{ eV}$.

* 2. Max Kinetic Energy: $K.E._{max} = e \times V_s = e \times 3.1 \text{ V} = 3.1 \text{ eV}$.

* 3. Work function ($\Phi$): $E = \Phi + K.E._{max} \implies 5.0 \text{ eV} = \Phi + 3.1 \text{ eV} \implies \Phi = 1.9 \text{ eV}$.

* 4. Threshold wavelength ($\lambda_0$): $\Phi = \frac{hc}{\lambda_0}$.

* $1.9 \text{ eV} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV-nm}}{\lambda_0} \implies \lambda_0 = \frac{1240}{1.9} \approx 652.63 \text{ nm}$.

* Rounding to the nearest integer gives 653.



**14. 3**

* Visible region = Balmer series (transitions ending at $n=2$).

* The electron starts at $n=5$. It can cascade, so all transitions from states $\le 5$ to $n=2$ are possible.

* These are:

    * $n=5 \to n=2$ ($\lambda \approx 434 \text{ nm}$, Violet) - Visible

    * $n=4 \to n=2$ ($\lambda \approx 486 \text{ nm}$, Blue-Green) - Visible

    * $n=3 \to n=2$ ($\lambda \approx 656 \text{ nm}$, Red) - Visible

* The transition $n=6 \to n=2$ is not possible as the electron starts at $n=5$.

* Thus, a maximum of 3 lines are in the visible (Balmer) region.

* Reason: The formula for radial nodes is $n - l - 1$. The reason states it is $n - l$. The reason is false.



**17. (A) $\to$ (Q), (T); (B) $\to$ (P); (C) $\to$ (R); (D) $\to$ (S)**

* (A) $1s$ orbital: $n=1, l=0$. In H-atom, $E = -13.6/n^2 = -13.6 \text{ eV}$ $\to$ **(Q)**. As an $s$-orbital, its $\psi$ is maximum (non-zero) at the nucleus $\to$ **(T)**.
