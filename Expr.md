## Answers & Explanations

### Section I (MCQ)

**1. (B)**
* **Explanation:** $x = \alpha t^2 - \beta t^3$.
* Velocity, $v = \frac{dx}{dt} = 2\alpha t - 3\beta t^2$.
* Acceleration, $a = \frac{dv}{dt} = 2\alpha - 6\beta t$.
* Set $a = 0 \implies 2\alpha - 6\beta t = 0 \implies 6\beta t = 2\alpha \implies t = \frac{2\alpha}{6\beta} = \frac{\alpha}{3\beta}$.

**2. (A)**
* **Explanation:** Velocity just before hitting ground: $v^2 = u^2 + 2as \implies v^2 = 0 + 2(g)(H) \implies v = \sqrt{2gH}$.
* Velocity just after rebound: $u' = v/2 = \frac{\sqrt{2gH}}{2}$.
* Height $h$ reached after rebound: $v_{final}^2 = (u')^2 - 2gh \implies 0 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2gH}}{2}\right)^2 - 2gh$.
* $2gh = \frac{2gH}{4} \implies h = \frac{H}{4}$.

**3. (D)**
* **Explanation:** At the highest point, velocity is purely horizontal, $v = v_x = u\cos\theta$.
* The acceleration is purely vertical (gravity), $a = g$.
* The velocity and acceleration vectors are perpendicular. Thus, the acceleration is purely centripetal.
* Radius of curvature $R_c = \frac{v^2}{a_c} = \frac{(u\cos\theta)^2}{g} = \frac{u^2 \cos^2\theta}{g}$.

**4. (C)**
* **Explanation:** Let $\vec{v}_r = v_x \hat{i} - v_y \hat{j}$ (assuming $\hat{j}$ is up). Let $\vec{v}_m = u \hat{i}$.
* Relative velocity $\vec{v}_{r/m} = \vec{v}_r - \vec{v}_m = (v_x - u)\hat{i} - v_y \hat{j}$.
* **Case 1:** $u = 3 \text{ m/s}$. Rain appears vertical. $x$-component is zero. $v_x - 3 = 0 \implies v_x = 3 \text{ m/s}$.
* **Case 2:** $u = 6 \text{ m/s}$. Appears at $45^\circ$. $\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{|\text{x-comp}|}{|\text{y-comp}|}$.
* $1 = \frac{|v_x - 6|}{|-v_y|} = \frac{|3 - 6|}{v_y} = \frac{3}{v_y} \implies v_y = 3 \text{ m/s}$.
* Actual speed of rain: $|\vec{v}_r| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + (-v_y)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \text{ m/s}$.

**5. (D)**
* **Explanation:** The velocity vector $\vec{v}$ is always tangential.
* Tangential acceleration $a_t = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d(kt)}{dt} = k$. This is in the same direction as $\vec{v}$.
* Centripetal (radial) acceleration $a_c = \frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{(kt)^2}{R} = \frac{k^2t^2}{R}$. This is perpendicular to $\vec{v}$.
* The net acceleration $\vec{a} = \vec{a}_t + \vec{a}_c$.
* The angle $\phi$ between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{v}$ (or $\vec{a}_t$) is given by $\tan\phi = \frac{a_c}{a_t} = \frac{k^2t^2/R}{k} = \frac{kt^2}{R}$.
* So, $\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{kt^2}{R}\right)$.

**6. (B)**
* **Explanation:** The standard trajectory equation is $y = x\tan\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2u^2\cos^2\theta}$.
* Compare this with the given equation: $y = \sqrt{3}x - \frac{g}{2}x^2$.
* By direct comparison of the $x$ coefficients: $\tan\theta = \sqrt{3}$.
* Therefore, $\theta = 60^\circ$.

**7. (C)**
* **Explanation:** The vertical motion is described by $y = u_y t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$.
* $h = (u\sin\theta)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$.
* Rearranging gives a quadratic equation for time $t$: $\frac{1}{2}gt^2 - (u\sin\theta)t + h = 0$.
* This equation has two roots, $t$ (time to reach $h$ going up) and $t'$ (time to reach $h$ coming down).
* By the property of quadratic equations (sum of roots): $t + t' = \frac{-b}{a} = \frac{-(-(u\sin\theta))}{g/2} = \frac{2u\sin\theta}{g}$.
* The term $\frac{2u\sin\theta}{g}$ is the total time of flight, $T$.
* So, $t + t' = T \implies t' = T - t = \frac{2u\sin\theta}{g} - t$.

### Section II (Multiple Correct)

**8. (B, C)**
* **Explanation:** Position of A: $x_A = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(2)t^2 = t^2$.
* Position of B: $x_B = x_0 + ut = 8 + ut$.
* For them to meet, $x_A = x_B \implies t^2 = 8 + ut \implies t^2 - ut - 8 = 0$.
* This is a quadratic in $t$. The discriminant is $D = (-u)^2 - 4(1)(-8) = u^2 + 32$.
* Since $u^2 \ge 0$, $D$ is always positive ($D > 0$). This means there are always two real roots. Since their product $c/a = -8$ (negative), one root is positive and one is negative. As $t>0$, there is always exactly one real, positive time $t$ when they meet.
* (A) is false. (B) is true.
* (C) If $u=0$, $t^2 - 8 = 0 \implies t = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \text{ s}$. Speed of A: $v_A = at = 2(2\sqrt{2}) = 4\sqrt{2} \text{ m/s}$. (C) is true.
* (D) If $u=-4$, $t^2 + 4t - 8 = 0$. $t = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4(1)(-8)}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{48}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 4\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}$. Since $t>0$, $t = (2\sqrt{3} - 2) \text{ s}$. (D) is false.

**9. (A, B, D)**
* **Explanation:**
* (A) For the same speed $u$, the range $R = \frac{u^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$ is the same for angles $\theta$ and $90^\circ - \theta$. So $\theta_1 + \theta_2 = 90^\circ$. (A) is true.
* (B) $T_1 = \frac{2u\sin\theta_1}{g}$ and $T_2 = \frac{2u\sin\theta_2}{g} = \frac{2u\sin(90-\theta_1)}{g} = \frac{2u\cos\theta_1}{g}$.
* $T_1 T_2 = \left(\frac{2u\sin\theta_1}{g}\right) \left(\frac{2u\cos\theta_1}{g}\right) = \frac{4u^2 \sin\theta_1 \cos\theta_1}{g^2} = \frac{2u^2 (2\sin\theta_1 \cos\theta_1)}{g^2} = \frac{2u^2 \sin(2\theta_1)}{g^2} = \frac{2R}{g}$. (B) is true.
* (C) $T_1^2 + T_2^2 = (\frac{2u}{g})^2 (\sin^2\theta_1 + \cos^2\theta_1) = \frac{4u^2}{g^2}$. (C) is false.
* (D) $H_1 = \frac{u^2 \sin^2\theta_1}{2g}$ and $H_2 = \frac{u^2 \sin^2\theta_2}{2g} = \frac{u^2 \cos^2\theta_1}{2g}$.
* $H_1 H_2 = \frac{u^4 \sin^2\theta_1 \cos^2\theta_1}{4g^2}$.
* $4\sqrt{H_1 H_2} = 4 \sqrt{\frac{u^4 (\sin\theta_1 \cos\theta_1)^2}{4g^2}} = 4 \frac{u^2 \sin\theta_1 \cos\theta_1}{2g} = \frac{2u^2 (2\sin\theta_1 \cos\theta_1)}{2g} = \frac{u^2 \sin(2\theta_1)}{g} = R$. (D) is true.

**10. (A, B, D)**
* **Explanation:**
* The slope of the $x-t$ graph is velocity $v$.
* We are given $v(t_1) > 0$ and $v(t_2) < 0$.
* (A) Average acceleration $a_{avg} = \frac{v(t_2) - v(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}$. The numerator is (negative - positive) = negative. The denominator is positive. So $a_{avg} < 0$. (A) is true.
* (B) Since velocity changes from positive to negative, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it must pass through $v=0$ at some point $t$ where $t_1 < t < t_2$. (B) is true.
* (C) We only know the velocities at $t_1$ and $t_2$, not for the entire interval. The acceleration could be variable. (C) is false.
* (D) Since the velocity changed sign (from positive to negative), the particle must have reversed its direction of motion. (D) is true.

**11. (A, D)**
* **Explanation:**
* (A) "Uniform" circular motion means speed is constant. (A) is true.
* (B) Velocity is a vector. Its direction is constantly changing (tangent to the circle). (B) is false.
* (C) Acceleration is $a_c = v^2/r$. Its magnitude is constant (since $v$ and $r$ are), but its direction is always changing (pointing to the center). (C) is false.
* (D) Kinetic Energy $K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Since $m$ and speed $v$ are constant, K.E. is constant. (D) is true.

### Section III (Numerical)

**12. Answer: 9**
* **Explanation:** $a = \frac{dv}{dt} = 3v^{1/2}$.
* Separate variables: $\frac{dv}{v^{1/2}} = 3 dt \implies \int v^{-1/2} dv = \int 3 dt$.
* Integrate: $\frac{v^{1/2}}{1/2} = 3t + C \implies 2\sqrt{v} = 3t + C$.
* At $t=0$, $v=0$ (starts from rest). $2\sqrt{0} = 3(0) + C \implies C = 0$.
* The equation is $2\sqrt{v} = 3t$.
* At $t=2 \text{ s}$: $2\sqrt{v} = 3(2) = 6 \implies \sqrt{v} = 3 \implies v = 9 \text{ m/s}$.

**13. Answer: 4**
* **Explanation:** $\vec{v}_r = 3\hat{i}$ (river flow).
* $\vec{v}_{m,r}$ (man w.r.t river) is $5 \text{ km/h}$ at $127^\circ$ to flow.
* $\vec{v}_{m,r} = 5\cos(127^\circ)\hat{i} + 5\sin(127^\circ)\hat{j}$.
* $\cos(127^\circ) = -\cos(53^\circ) = -3/5$. $\sin(127^\circ) = \sin(53^\circ) = 4/5$.
* $\vec{v}_{m,r} = 5(-3/5)\hat{i} + 5(4/5)\hat{j} = -3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}$.
* Actual velocity of man $\vec{v}_m = \vec{v}_{m,r} + \vec{v}_r = (-3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}) + 3\hat{i} = 4\hat{j}$.
* The velocity component perpendicular to the bank (used for crossing) is $v_y = 4 \text{ km/h}$.
* Time to cross = Width / $v_y = 1 \text{ km} / 4 \text{ km/h} = 1/4 \text{ hours}$.
* Given Time = $1/x$. So, $x=4$.

**14. Answer: 2**
* **Explanation:** For a projectile on an inclined plane, we align the axes. Let $x'$ be along the incline ($\alpha=30^\circ$) and $y'$ be perpendicular to it.
* Acceleration due to gravity $\vec{g}$ has components: $a_{y'} = -g\cos\alpha$ and $a_{x'} = -g\sin\alpha$.
* The initial velocity $u=10 \text{ m/s}$ is at $\beta=60^\circ$ to the incline.
* $u_{y'} = u\sin\beta = 10\sin(60^\circ)$.
* The time of flight $T$ is the time taken for the $y'$ displacement to become zero.
* $s_{y'} = u_{y'}T + \frac{1}{2}a_{y'}T^2 \implies 0 = (u\sin\beta)T - \frac{1}{2}(g\cos\alpha)T^2$.
* $T = \frac{2u\sin\beta}{g\cos\alpha} = \frac{2(10)\sin(60^\circ)}{10\cos(30^\circ)} = \frac{20(\sqrt{3}/2)}{10(\sqrt{3}/2)} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{5\sqrt{3}} = 2 \text{ s}$.

**15. Answer: 2**
* **Explanation:** This is a relative motion problem.
* Initial position of A: $\vec{r}_A(0) = 0$.
* Initial position of B: $\vec{r}_B(0) = 10\hat{i}$.
* Initial relative position: $\vec{r}_{BA}(0) = \vec{r}_B(0) - \vec{r}_A(0) = 10\hat{i}$.
* Velocity of A: $\vec{v}_A = 2\hat{i}$.
* Velocity of B: $\vec{v}_B = 1\hat{i} + 1\hat{j}$.
* Relative velocity: $\vec{v}_{BA} = \vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A = (1\hat{i} + 1\hat{j}) - (2\hat{i}) = -1\hat{i} + 1\hat{j}$.
* The relative position at time $t$ is $\vec{r}_{BA}(t) = \vec{r}_{BA}(0) + \vec{v}_{BA} t = 10\hat{i} + (-1\hat{i} + 1\hat{j})t = (10-t)\hat{i} + t\hat{j}$.
* The distance squared is $D^2 = |\vec{r}_{BA}(t)|^2 = (10-t)^2 + t^2$.
* To find the minimum distance, we minimize $D^2$. $\frac{d(D^2)}{dt} = 2(10-t)(-1) + 2t = -20 + 2t + 2t = 4t - 20$.
* Set $\frac{d(D^2)}{dt} = 0 \implies 4t - 20 = 0 \implies t = 5 \text{ s}$.
* The minimum distance $D_{min}$ occurs at $t=5$.
* $D_{min}^2 = (10-5)^2 + 5^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 25 = 50$.
* $D_{min} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$.
* We are given $D_{min} = 10/\sqrt{k}$.
* $5\sqrt{2} = 10/\sqrt{k} \implies \sqrt{2} = 2/\sqrt{k} \implies \sqrt{2k} = 2 \implies 2k = 4 \implies k=2$.

**16. Answer: 4.83**
* **Explanation:** $v(t) = t^2 - 5t + 6 = (t-2)(t-3)$.
* The velocity $v(t)$ is zero at $t=2$ and $t=3$. The particle changes direction at $t=2$.
* Distance = $\int_0^3 |v(t)| dt = \int_0^2 (t^2 - 5t + 6) dt + \left| \int_2^3 (t^2 - 5t + 6) dt \right|$.
* $\int (t^2 - 5t + 6) dt = \frac{t^3}{3} - \frac{5t^2}{2} + 6t$.
* Part 1: $[\frac{t^3}{3} - \frac{5t^2}{2} + 6t]_0^2 = (\frac{8}{3} - \frac{5(4)}{2} + 12) - 0 = \frac{8}{3} - 10 + 12 = \frac{8}{3} + 2 = \frac{14}{3}$.
* Part 2: $[\frac{t^3}{3} - \frac{5t^2}{2} + 6t]_2^3 = (\frac{27}{3} - \frac{5(9)}{2} + 18) - (\frac{14}{3}) = (9 - 22.5 + 18) - \frac{14}{3} = 4.5 - \frac{14}{3} = \frac{9}{2} - \frac{14}{3} = \frac{27 - 28}{6} = -\frac{1}{6}$.
* Total distance $D = \frac{14}{3} + |-\frac{1}{6}| = \frac{14}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{28}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{29}{6}$.
* $D = 29 / 6 \approx 4.8333...$ Rounded to two decimal places, $D = 4.83$.

**17. Answer: 1**
* **Explanation:** We need acceleration $a$. Since $v$ is a function of position $x$, we use $a = v \frac{dv}{dx}$.
* $v = \beta x^{-2n}$.
* $\frac{dv}{dx} = \beta (-2n) x^{-2n-1} = -2n\beta x^{-2n-1}$.
* $a = v \frac{dv}{dx} = (\beta x^{-2n}) (-2n\beta x^{-2n-1})$.
* $a = (-2n\beta^2) x^{(-2n) + (-2n-1)} = (-2n\beta^2) x^{-4n-1}$.
* We are given $a \propto x^m$. By comparing, $m = -4n-1$.
* The question states $m = -4n-k$.
* Comparing $-4n-1$ and $-4n-k$, we get $k=1$.

* **(R) Tangential acceleration ($a_t$):**
* $a_t$ is the projection of $\vec{a}$ onto $\vec{v}$.
* $a_t = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{v}}{|\vec{v}|} = \frac{(4\hat{i} + 6\hat{j}) \cdot (4\hat{i} - 1\hat{j})}{\sqrt{17}} = \frac{4(4) + 6(-1)}{\sqrt{17}} = \frac{16 - 6}{\sqrt{17}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{17}}$.
* **(R) $\to$ (1)**
*
* **(S) Centripetal acceleration ($a_c$):**
* Net acceleration $a_{net}^2 = a_t^2 + a_c^2$.
* $|\vec{a}(1)|^2 = a_t^2 + a_c^2 \implies (\sqrt{52})^2 = \left(\frac{10}{\sqrt{17}}\right)^2 + a_c^2$.
* $52 = \frac{100}{17} + a_c^2$.
* $a_c^2 = 52 - \frac{100}{17} = \frac{52 \times 17 - 100}{17} = \frac{884 - 100}{17} = \frac{784}{17}$.
* $a_c = \sqrt{\frac{784}{17}} = \frac{28}{\sqrt{17}}$.
