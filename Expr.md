### **26. Explain Project planning CPM techniques.**

**Critical Path Method (CPM)** is a deterministic project planning technique used when activity times are known and fixed. It is widely used in construction and manufacturing to optimize resource allocation and cost control.

**Steps in CPM:**

1. **Identify Activities:** List all tasks required to complete the project.
2. **Sequence Activities:** Determine the dependency between tasks.
3. **Draw Network Diagram:** Visual representation of the sequence.
4. **Estimate Time:** Assign a fixed duration to each activity.
5. **Identify Critical Path:** Calculate the longest path through the network; this determines the shortest time in which the project can be completed.
6. **Control:** Focus on critical activities to prevent delays, as any delay on the critical path delays the entire project.

**Equation for Earliest/Latest times (Concept):**
$$ EST = \max(EFT \text{ of predecessors}) $$
$$ LST = \min(LS \text{ of successors}) - \text{Duration} $$
*(Source: Ent_345.pdf, Page 53)*

---

### **27. Explain PERT Techniques in detail.**

**Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)** is a probabilistic model used for project management when activity durations are uncertain, such as in R&D or new product development. Unlike CPM, PERT accounts for time variation by using three time estimates for each activity.

**Three Time Estimates:**

1. **Optimistic time ():** The minimum time required if everything goes perfectly.
2. **Most likely time ():** The time required under normal conditions.
3. **Pessimistic time ():** The maximum time required if things go wrong.

**Expected Time () Formula:**
The weighted average of the three estimates is calculated as:
$$ TE = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6} $$

**Key Features:**

* **Event-Oriented:** Focuses on the start and completion of events.
* **Risk Analysis:** Helps in analyzing the probability of completing a project by a scheduled date.
* **Network Diagram:** Similar to CPM, it uses a network to visualize tasks but focuses on the uncertainty of time.

### **28. Explain Time management strengths and weaknesses in detail.**

Time management approaches have distinct strengths and weaknesses that entrepreneurs must navigate:

**Strengths:**

* **Productivity:** Effective time management allows individuals to accomplish more in less time.
* **Stress Reduction:** By prioritizing tasks (e.g., using the Matrix), entrepreneurs reduce the anxiety of "fire-fighting" urgent issues.
* **Goal Achievement:** It ensures time is allocated to Quadrant II (Important/Not Urgent) activities like planning, which drives long-term success.
* **Resource Optimization:** Helps in identifying key uses of time and minimizing waste on trivial activities.

**Weaknesses (Potential Pitfalls):**

* **Urgency Addiction:** Entrepreneurs may become addicted to the "rush" of solving urgent problems (Quadrant I & III), neglecting long-term planning.
* **Rigidity:** Over-structuring time can reduce flexibility, which is often needed in dynamic entrepreneurial environments.
* **Misidentification:** Failing to distinguish between "Urgent" and "Important" leads to spending time on Quadrant III (Deception), thinking it is productive.

### **32. Explain in a detail about project organization.**

Project organization is the structure that facilitates the coordination and implementation of project activities. It defines the relationships between the project manager, the team, and other stakeholders.

**Types of Project Organization:**

1. **Functional Organization:** Based on traditional departments (e.g., Marketing, Finance). It offers specialization but may lead to slow decision-making and poor coordination across project tasks.
2. **Project (Pure) Organization:** A separate, independent unit is created for the project. The project manager has full authority. It ensures fast decisions and strong control but can be costly due to resource duplication.
3. **Matrix Organization:** A hybrid structure where staff report to both a functional manager and a project manager. It offers flexibility and optimal resource use but can cause conflict due to dual authority.

**Key Roles:**

* **Project Manager:** Leads the project, responsible for success/failure.
* **Functional Specialists:** Provide technical expertise.
* **Project Support Team:** Assists with administration and logistics.

### **34. Describe in detail about project planning and control using CPM and PERT techniques.**

Project planning and control are essential to ensure a project is completed on time and within resources. Two major network techniques used are CPM and PERT.

**A. Critical Path Method (CPM):**
CPM is used for projects with well-defined, predictable activities (e.g., construction).

* **Process:** It involves breaking down the project into activities, determining their sequence, and estimating a fixed duration for each.
* **Critical Path:** The longest sequence of dependent tasks is identified. This path determines the minimum project duration. If any task on this path is delayed, the project is delayed.
* **Control:** Managers focus on critical activities. "Float" or "Slack" is calculated for non-critical tasks to see how much they can be delayed without affecting the deadline.

**B. Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT):**
PERT is used for projects with high uncertainty (e.g., R&D).

* **Probabilistic Time:** It uses three estimates (, , ) to calculate a weighted average Expected Time ().
* **Variance:** It calculates variance to understand the risk and uncertainty associated with time estimates.
* **Control:** It allows managers to calculate the probability of meeting a specific deadline using standard deviation concepts.

**Comparison:**

* **CPM** is deterministic (Time is known) and cost-oriented.
* **PERT** is probabilistic (Time is uncertain) and event-oriented.
